2022 - Mission failed

first year attempting aoc, had no idea what to expect, never done problems like these before.
was manageable until day 7, then it took a sharp turn off a cliff and got to the point where it was taking me ~2 hours, a lot of brain power and unnecessary stress to solve and I just didn't have that kind of time to spare unfortunately.

until next year ðŸ«¡
